Webhooks allow external services to send messages to your Hazel channels via HTTP requests. Use them to integrate CI/CD pipelines, monitoring services, or any application that can make HTTP requests.

## Use Cases

- **CI/CD Notifications** - Post build status, deployment alerts, and test results
- **Monitoring Alerts** - Send alerts from uptime monitors, error trackers, or APM tools
- **Custom Integrations** - Connect any service that supports outgoing webhooks
- **Automation** - Trigger notifications from scripts, cron jobs, or serverless functions

## Quick Example

Send a simple message to a channel:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hazel.app/webhooks/incoming/{webhookId}/{token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Hello from webhook!"}'
```

Or send a rich embed:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hazel.app/webhooks/incoming/{webhookId}/{token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "embeds": [{
      "title": "Deployment Complete",
      "description": "Successfully deployed to production",
      "color": 5025616
    }]
  }'
```
