This guide walks you through creating a webhook and sending messages to a Hazel channel.

## Create a Webhook

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open Channel Settings

    Navigate to the channel where you want to receive webhook messages. Click the channel name to open settings, then select the **Webhooks** tab.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create New Webhook

    Click **Create Webhook** and fill in the details:

    - **Name** (required) - A display name for the webhook (e.g., "GitHub Actions", "Uptime Monitor")
    - **Description** (optional) - A note about what this webhook is for
    - **Avatar URL** (optional) - Custom avatar image for webhook messages

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Copy the Webhook URL

    After creating the webhook, you'll see the full webhook URL with the token. **Copy this immediately** - the token is only shown once for security reasons.

    The URL format is:
    ```
    https://api.hazel.app/webhooks/incoming/{webhookId}/{token}
    ```

    If you lose the token, you can regenerate it from the webhook settings, but this will invalidate the old URL.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Send Your First Message

### Plain Text Message

Send a simple text message using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Hello from my webhook!"}'
```

### Message with Embed

Send a formatted message with an embed:

```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "embeds": [{
      "title": "Build Successful",
      "description": "All tests passed",
      "color": 5025616,
      "fields": [
        {"name": "Branch", "value": "main", "inline": true},
        {"name": "Commit", "value": "abc1234", "inline": true}
      ]
    }]
  }'
```

### Using JavaScript/TypeScript

```typescript
const webhookUrl = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

await fetch(webhookUrl, {
	method: "POST",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
	body: JSON.stringify({
		content: "Deployment complete!",
		embeds: [
			{
				title: "Production Deploy",
				description: "v1.2.3 is now live",
				color: 5025616,
				timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
			},
		],
	}),
})
```

## Request Format

### Endpoint

```
POST /webhooks/incoming/{webhookId}/{token}
```

### Headers

| Header         | Value              | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes      |

### Body

```typescript
{
  content?: string      // Plain text message
  embeds?: Embed[]      // Array of embeds (max 10)
}
```

At least one of `content` or `embeds` must be provided.

### Response

**Success (200)**:

```json
{
	"messageId": "msg_abc123",
	"channelId": "ch_xyz789"
}
```

**Error (4xx/5xx)**:

```json
{
	"error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Keep Your Token Secret">
    The webhook token acts as a password. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly. Use environment variables or secret management tools to store it.

    ```bash
    # Good - use environment variable
    curl -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" -d '...'

    # Bad - hardcoded token
    curl -X POST "https://api.hazel.app/webhooks/incoming/abc/secret123" -d '...'
    ```

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regenerate Compromised Tokens">
	If your webhook token is accidentally exposed, regenerate it immediately from the channel settings. This
	invalidates the old URL and creates a new one.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS">
    Always use HTTPS URLs when configuring webhooks in external services. This ensures the token is encrypted in transit.
  </Accordion>
