 * - OrganizationMemberDelete: Remove a user from an organization
 *
 * All methods require authentication via AuthMiddleware.

 * Example usage from frontend:
 * ```typescript
 * const client = yield* RpcClient
 *
 * // Create organization member
 * const result = yield* client.OrganizationMemberCreate({
 *   organizationId: "...",
 *   role: "member"
 * })
 *
 * // Update organization member
 * yield* client.OrganizationMemberUpdate({
 *   id: "...",
 *   role: "admin"
 * })
 *
 * // Delete organization member
 * yield* client.OrganizationMemberDelete({ id: "..." })
 * ```
